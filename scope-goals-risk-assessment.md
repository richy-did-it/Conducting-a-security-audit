- Existing password policy is nominal and not fully compliant with modern complexity standards  
- No centralized password management system  
- Legacy systems monitored but without a regular schedule or clear intervention methods  
- Physical security: locks, CCTV, fire detection, and prevention systems are sufficient across offices, store, and warehouse
